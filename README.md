## Evaluator Recruitment
The Evaluator Recruitment Page is accessible through https://rannyrh.github.io/luigi_eval/
The content in `index.html` explains relevant requirements, such as evaluators' background and availability, and evaluation procedures.

## Case Assignment Randomization
The Randomization Code in `randomized.ipynb` is used to assign cases to evaluators in a randomized manner. This ensures:
- A fair distribution of cases.
- Balanced assignment of cases across evaluators based on the rarity in the database.
- Minimization of bias in case assignments.
